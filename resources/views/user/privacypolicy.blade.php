         <h4>Collection of personal information</h4>
         <p>You can access and use the Mobile Application and Services without telling us who you are
            or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable
            individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features offered in the Mobile
            Application, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your
            name and e-mail address).
         </p>
         <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an
            account, make a purchase, or fill any forms in the Mobile Application. When required, this
            information may include the following:
         </p>
         <p>-  Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)</p>
         <p>- Contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc)</p>
         <p>- Basic personal information (such as name, country of residence, etc)</p>
         <p>- Biometric information (such as facial recognition)</p>
         <p>- Certain features on the mobile device (such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc)</p>
         <p>- Any other materials you willingly submit to us (such as articles, images, feedback, etc)</p>
         <p>Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Mobile Application and
            Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources
            such as public databases and our joint marketing partners.
         </p>
         <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be
            able to take advantage of some of the features in the Mobile Application. Users who are
            uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

         <h4>Privacy of children</h4>
         <p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to Personal
            Information we may collect from children under the age of 13 and take many special
            precautions to protect their privacy. We do not require any Personal Information from
            children at any time. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has
            provided Personal Information to us through the Mobile Application and Services, please
            contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our Services.
         </p>
         <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to
            help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information
            through the Mobile Application and Services without their permission. We also ask that all
            parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions
            to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when
            online without their permission. We believe parents and legal guardians should be involved
            in the online activities of their children and suggest that parents do their best to provide
            their children with a safe and friendly online environment.

         <h4>Use and processing of collected information</h4>
         <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information,
            unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would
            be the data controller and we would be the data processor.
         </p>
         <p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information.
            We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal
            Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Mobile Application and
            Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes
            and means of the processing of Personal Information.
         </p>
         <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal
            Information through the Mobile Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make
            decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is
            processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing
            Personal Information acts as a data controller.
         </p>
         <p>In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal
            obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not
            provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the
            requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for
            the following purposes:
         </p>
         <p>- Create and manage user accounts</p>
         <p>- Send administrative information</p>
         <p>- Request user feedback</p>
         <p>- Improve user experience</p>
         <p>- Enforce terms and conditions and policies</p>
         <p>- Protect from abuse and malicious users</p>
         <p>- Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</p>
         <p>- Run and operate the Mobile Application and Services</p>
         <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Mobile
            Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following
            applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of
            information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any precontractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
            obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in
            the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is
            necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
         </p>
         <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you
            object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of
            the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to
            the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a
            statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

         <h4>Payment processing</h4>
         <p>In case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your credit card details or
            other payment account information, which will be used solely for processing payments. We
            use third-party payment processors (“Payment Processors”) to assist us in processing your
            payment information securely.
         </p>
         <p>Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security
            Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express
            and Discover. Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured
            communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures, and the
            Mobile Application and Services are also in compliance with strict vulnerability standards in
            order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users. We will share payment
            data with the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the purposes of
            processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing with complaints and
            queries related to such payments and refunds
         </p>
         <p>Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you,
            which allows them to process your payments (e.g., your email address, address, credit card
            details, and bank account number) and handle all the steps in the payment process through
            their systems, including data collection and data processing. The Payment Processors’ use of
            your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may
            not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest that you review their
            respective privacy policies.

         <h4>Managing information</h4>
         <p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal
            Information you can delete may change as the Mobile Application and Services change.
            When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised
            Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our
            obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.

         <h4>Disclosure of information</h4>
         <p>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or
            provide any Service you have requested, we may share your information with our affiliates,
            contracted companies, and service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon
            to assist in the operation of the Mobile Application and Services available to you and whose
            privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect
            to Personal Information. We will not share any personally identifiable information with third
            parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties
         </p>
         <p>Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary
            to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are
            given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we
            do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own
            marketing or other purposes.
         </p>
         <p>We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or
            permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we
            believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or
            the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
         </p>
         <p>In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another
            company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and your Personal
            Information will likely be among the assets transferred.

         <h4>Retention of information</h4>
         <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with
            our legal obligations, as long as your user account remains active, to enforce our
            agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted
            by law.
         </p>
         <p>We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information
            after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once
            the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to
            access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot
            be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

         <h4>Push notifications</h4>
         <p>We offer push notifications to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. To make
            sure push notifications reach the correct devices, we rely on a device token unique to your
            device which is issued by the operating system of your device. While it is possible to access
            a list of device tokens, they will not reveal your identity, your unique device ID, or your
            contact information to us. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance
            with applicable laws and regulations. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push
            notifications, simply adjust your device settings accordingly.

            such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the

         <h4>Information security</h4>
         <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure

            reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against
            unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our
            control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network
            can be guaranteed.

         <p>Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i)

         </p>
         <p>As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the security of the device you
            use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your credentials, please
